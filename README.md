# drupal-task-bonus

This Drupal 7 project was created to match the Geek Label designs



## Project Highlights
- I did not use regions for the structure of this drupal site because it is a single page website. After I did some research on Drupal's best practices, I concluded that this may be the best and simplest way of implementing an SPA. As a result, all of the HTML was placed in the *page.tpl.php*
- Again, I tried to add as much detail as I could see, and this time I got a chance to work with some Javascript for the *scroll to next* buttons.
- I enjoyed working on this site because the CSS framework (Bootstrap 3) sped things up a great deal.


## Unique Features
- I made the layout as responsive, as I possibly could (ideally, most devices should work with the styling).
- Some of the page's content/text changes with different screen sizes (it is not just the layout that is responsive).
- The services section has a special tablet layout.
- The custom map marker displays the address when clicked.
- The inset shadow effects that I added to the map, only cover small portions of it (so a user can still manipulate the contents of the map).
- The map marker is always centered in the map (reload the page if it is not - Google's map space is responsive but the contents are not).
- The *scroll to next* buttons are functional.
